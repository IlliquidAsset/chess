# Chessy Project Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for Chessy, a chess analysis tool. The project is structured in phases, focusing on core functionality, user experience, and scalability. The initial priorities are stabilizing the existing features, implementing robust background processing, and improving the user interface. Later phases will introduce new features and performance optimizations.

## Current Status (as of March 2025)

Several core features have been implemented, including:

*   Basic game analysis using Stockfish.
*   ECO code integration (using the `python-chess` library).
*   A functional (but improvable) user interface.

Ongoing work includes:

*   Fixing known bugs (error handling, "Clear Games" functionality).
*   Improving the UI (responsiveness, dark mode).

## Priorities and Timeline

The project is divided into phases, with estimated timelines. These timelines are subject to change based on development progress and resource availability.

### Phase 1: Core Functionality & Stability (Immediate - 4 weeks)

**Focus:** Solidifying the foundation and addressing immediate issues.

*   **Task 1:  Bug Fixes & UI Improvements (1-2 weeks)**
    *   Fix "Clear Games" functionality.
    *   Implement dark mode persistence (client-side, using cookies).
    *   Improve error handling and logging throughout the application.  Add user-friendly error messages.
    *   Enhance UI responsiveness and fix layout issues.
    *   Add a proper footer to the application.
    *   **Documentation:**
        *   Update User Manual sections related to bug fixes and UI changes.

*   **Task 2:  Background Processing with Celery (2-3 weeks)**
    *   **Goal:** Move game importing and analysis to background tasks to prevent UI freezing and improve reliability.
    *   Set up Celery with Redis as the message broker and result backend.
    *   Refactor `download_games` into a Celery task.  *Crucially, handle Chess.com API rate limits using retries with exponential backoff and respect for the `Retry-After` header.*
    *   Refactor `analyze_games` into a Celery task.
    *   Implement a `TaskTracker` class (or similar) to manage task status (using Redis for primary storage and disk-based JSON as a backup).
    *   Create a basic API for task management (status, cancellation â€“ though full cancellation might be deferred to a later phase).
    *   Update the frontend to:
        *   Display task progress (percentage, elapsed time, status messages).
        *   Provide a basic indication of background activity.
        *   Handle errors gracefully (e.g., API errors, task failures).
        *    Fetch the user's Chess.com Username.
    *   **Dependencies:** This builds upon the completed `enhance/progress-tracking` branch.
    * **Documentation:**
        *   **Developer Setup Guide:** Add requirements for Redis and Celery (installation, configuration, environment variables).
        *   **Architecture Documentation:** Create/update diagrams and explanations for system components (Flask, Celery, Redis, database), data flow, task lifecycle, and error handling.
        *   **API Documentation:**  Document the new and updated API endpoints (`/api/task_status`, `/api/task/<task_id>`, potentially `/api/cancel_task/<task_id>`).
        *   **User Manual:** Update user interface sections to explain new progress indicators, background task monitoring, and improved error messages.
        *   **Testing Strategy Document:** Outline the approach for unit testing (pytest), integration testing (with Celery), mocking, and testing background tasks.
        *  **Code Style Guide:** Create or update to include type hinting standards, docstring requirements, error handling patterns, and logging conventions.

### Phase 2:  Initial User Input & Configuration (2 weeks)

* **Goal:** Allow the user to input their Chess.com username and an email address (no user accounts/authentication yet).
    * Implement a simple form for username and email input.
    * Store the entered information (session storage is sufficient for now, but consider a database for future scalability).
    * Use the provided username for Chess.com API requests.
    * Consider displaying the entered username in the UI.
* This should require the creation of new pages, and modifications of existing ones, at a minimum.
    *   **Documentation:**
        *   Update User Manual to reflect the new input form and how the information is used.

### Phase 3:  Performance and Refinement (Ongoing)

*   **Goal:** Improve performance, address technical debt, and prepare for future features.

    *   **Refactor `server.py`:** Split the large `server.py` file into smaller, more manageable modules (e.g., `routes.py`, `database.py`, `chess_data.py`, `tasks.py`, `utils.py`).  Focus on separation of concerns.
    *   **Database Optimization:**  Ensure database queries are efficient (use appropriate indexes). Profile and optimize slow queries.
    *   **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data (if necessary, after profiling).
    *   **Code Review and Cleanup:**  Address any remaining TODOs, improve code style, and add type hints.
     *   **Documentation:**
        *   Update Architecture Documentation to reflect the refactored code structure.
        *  **Deployment Guide**: Update and expand, especially regarding database migrations, process monitoring.

### Future Phases (Beyond Initial Implementation)

These features are planned but are lower priority than the initial phases. The order and scope may be adjusted.

*   **User Accounts (Long-Term):** Full user registration, login, password management, and profile settings. This is a significant undertaking and will be revisited after the core functionality is stable.
*   **Settings Page (Medium-Term):** A dedicated page for user-configurable settings (e.g., default analysis options, theme). This would initially be used to manage the Chess.com Username.
*   **Interruptible Analysis (Medium-Term):** Allow pausing and resuming analysis. This depends on the background processing implementation.
*   **Batch Processing (Medium-Term):**  Efficiently handle large numbers of games.
*   **Advanced Analysis Metrics (Long-Term):**  Position evaluation over time, mistake categorization, time management analysis.
*   **Opening Explorer (Long-Term):**  Interactive opening tree with move recommendations.
*   **Game Exports (Medium-Term):**  Allow exporting games in PGN format.
*   **Enhanced API Integration (Long-Term):** Support for additional chess platforms, real-time game monitoring.
*  **Documentation (Ongoing throughout all future phases):**
    *   Update all relevant documents (User Manual, API Documentation, Architecture Documentation, etc.) as new features are added.
    *   **Security Guidelines:** Document security best practices for Redis, API endpoints, input validation, and data sanitization.  This becomes *especially* important when user accounts are implemented.
    * Consider creating a public-facing changelog.

## Technical Considerations

*   **Technology Stack:** Flask, Celery, Redis, SQLAlchemy, pytest, JavaScript.
*   **Deployment:**  Separate worker processes (Celery) from the web server (Flask). Use a process manager like Supervisor.
*   **Testing:**  Comprehensive unit and integration tests are essential. Mock external dependencies (like the Chess.com API) during testing.
*   **Configuration:** Use environment variables (with `python-dotenv`) for configuration settings.
* **Security:** Although user authentication is not implemented yet, basic security should be considered. Protect against cross-site scripting by using best practices in building the UI.

## Success Metrics

*   **Improved User Experience:**  The UI remains responsive even during long-running operations.
*   **Reliable Background Processing:** Games are imported and analyzed reliably, even if the server restarts.
*   **Reduced Server Load:**  Eliminate unnecessary polling.
*   **Clear Progress Indication:**  Users can easily see the status of ongoing tasks.
*   **Error Handling:**  Errors are handled gracefully and reported to the user appropriately.

This integrated roadmap now clearly shows how documentation fits into the development process. By including documentation tasks within each phase, you ensure that it's not an afterthought but an integral part of building the application. This makes the roadmap more complete and actionable. Remember that documentation is a "living" thing, requiring constant attention and updating as the project progresses.
